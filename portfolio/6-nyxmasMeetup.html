                <p>This was a very quick game that I created for a collaborative art project. I had been developing another game before this one but I realized that the other game would take a long time to finish. What I decided to do was to split different features of that game apart and to start using them to create smaller and more focused games. In this case, I already had a prototype cutscene manager and I copied over the code into Nyxmas Meetup.</p>
                <p>I also coded up an overhead rpg style walking character. I wanted to branch away from platformers because I was realizing that platformers require a lot of animation and code, especially if you're trying to make them interesting. Rpg style controls are simpler and allow you to focus on other things, like cutscenes.</p>
                <p>I will say, actually using the prototype cutscene manager for a game revealed a lot of issues in how it needed to be used, and I ended up rewriting the code for the next game I used it in. I learnt that making very small games is actually a very good way to test game dev tools that you make.</p>
