                <p>This was my first time properly coding and using the Unity engine on my own! The first GMTK game jam was happening and I saw it as a good opportunity to jump in and start creating.</p>
                <p>I decided to go with a 2d platformer again because it was a format that I had experience with from the last game I made. The theme of the jam was Dual Purpose Design, so I wanted to find simple parts of the Unity engine that I could attach together that would give more than one effect from simple actions. What I settled on in the end was attaching the height of the character to the orthogonal size of the Unity camera, which makes jumping into a way to increase visibility and feel more open.</p>
                <p>Coding the platforming mechanics was more difficult than expected as there were a lot of unexpected pitfalls, including knowing when jumping is possible for the character. I potentially over scoped by trying to add a wall jumping mechanic when I didn't know how to implement normal platforming when I started, which made the wall jumping a little frustrating to use. That said, I do like the particle effects I used in the second half of the game, which were easy as they didn't involve any code besides an on/off check, but they created a very cool trail effect when the player started sprinting.</p>
                <p>I drew up a level in a sprite editor and added the colliders after this over the top. I realized after this that doing this took a lot of time and wasn't very impressive visually, so I planned on using a tool like a tile editor for my next game.</p>
                <p>Reviews of the game from other jammers were about average, I believe the bad looking level and floaty controls were the reason for this.</p>
