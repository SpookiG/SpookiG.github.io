            <p>Hi it's me, Spooki G! Or M. Laycock as well. I enjoy working on a lot of different creative things, I especially enjoy using my knowledge in creative ways in order to express interesting ideas! I have a strong eye for detail and I am very thorough with my work. When applied practically, this means that I will put in extra attention into small additions that will enhance a project. It also means I am very good at catching bugs and other functional issues as I go. I am very passionate about games and the kinds of unique experiences that can be created with them.</p>
            <p>I coded up this website in html, javascript, and css. I hope you have a good time using it!!</p>
