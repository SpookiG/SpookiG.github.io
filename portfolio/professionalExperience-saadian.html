                <p>I began working for Saadian as part of a 3 week paid internship. During this time I was given the task of learning AWS Lambda and integrating it with the Slack api to create a Slackbot that could perform multiple functions. I managed to accomplish this and document my work within the three weeks. I was given a 3-4 month extension due to the amount of work I had managed to accomplish as well as the thoroughness of my documentation.</p>
                <p>During my extended internship I was given the task of creating and documenting a database parser that would copy spreadsheets to push to a database. Shortly after this, though, I was tasked with learning the configuration for a complex content management system that we were using to generate a website for a client. During this time I had to discuss frequently with the development team to work out when configuration settings were not working as intended, and I updated configuration documentation based on these discussions. Near the end of the extended internship, I was given an offer to extend my contract again but as a Systems Operations Engineer.</p>
                <p>As I continued to work with the complex content management system, more of the configuration required the use of a custom markup language that was hardcoded into the software. This language wasn't yet documented and it was still buggy due to it's continuous development. Because of this, I found a consistent way to test the language, and then did a deep dive into it along with the different parts of the syntax. After this I was able to create a long detailed breakdown of exactly how each part of the language worked and how to program different parts of the functionality. I was also able to configure workarounds to functionality issues whilst devs fixed defects in other parts of the markup language.</p>
                <p>During my time as a Systems Operations Engineer, I was also tasked with defect management, which involved the replication of bugs, and then the creation of bug reports with detailed instructions on how to replicate. These bug reports often used screenshots and videos for demonstrations. I was also involved in technical support work for some of the company's other software products.</p>
                <p>My time at Saadian was appreciated a lot and my work was complimented fairly often.</p>
