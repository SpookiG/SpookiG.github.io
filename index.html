            <p>Hi it's me, Spooki G! Or M. Laycock as well.</p>
            <p>I am a graduate with a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Warwick. I have about a year of experience as a Junior Systems Operations Engineer, managing multiple software related roles including configuration, documentation, testing, and defect management. I'm currently based in the UK and am interested in moving to a software development role in the games industry.</p>
            <p>I picked up games development by chance when me and some friends decided to take part in a Global Game Jam event at university. I fell in love with the whole process and decided to learn Unity and start making games myself. I have created 9 games, and you can see details about these on the games page of this website.</p>
            <p>I have experience coding in C#, C++, C, Javascript, Python, Java, and various other languages. My games are created in Unity and this is the engine I have the most experience with.</p>


            <p>I enjoy working on a lot of different creative things, I especially enjoy using my knowledge in creative ways in order to express interesting ideas! I have a strong eye for detail and I am very thorough with my work. When applied practically, this means that I will put in extra attention into small additions that will enhance a project. It also means I am very good at catching bugs and other functional issues as I go. I am very passionate about games and the kinds of unique experiences that can be created with them.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in some of the other creative thing I have done, you can find my streaming and photography accounts in the hobbies section of this website, and you can find a little music in the music section!</p>
            <p>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:laycockmichael@yahoo.co.uk">laycockmichael@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>
            <p>Also! I coded up this website in html, javascript, and css. I hope you have a good time using it!!</p>
