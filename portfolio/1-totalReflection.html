                <p>This was the first game I worked on. Me and two of my friends decided to take part in the university's Global Game Jam. Josh was well versed in Unity and handled a lot of the game code, and Bradley learnt the engine whilst creating the lazer and switch systems. I ended up in charge of the art and design parts of the game.</p>
                <p>Because I was an outsider to the unity engine, once we had a general idea for the game I had to communicate a lot with Josh and Bradley over what was possible in Unity within the time frame. Levels had to fit in a single screen because we didn't have a moving camera; some animations needed armless versions so that the character could hold the mirror without extra hands; levels needed to showcase the game mechanics.</p>
                <p>I learnt a little bit about the Unity engine, and with Josh's help I added a music playing gameobject that remained active between levels. The main thing, though, is that this really showed me that interesting games can be developed within a fairly short amount of time. This game jam inspired me to want to make my own games.</p>
