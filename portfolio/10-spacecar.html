                <p>This was a game I created in order to learn Unreal engine and the C++ workflow. The time from starting learning the engine to finishing the game was just over a month, though I was also overhauling my portfolio during this time so the amount of work put into this game would be closer to 3-4 weeks.</p>
                <p>My goal was to start with a simple set of physics mechanics and then to learn other parts of the engine whilst I added features to the game. The main issues that extended the time spent on the project came from these physics mechanics being deceivingly complex. These mechanics were based around creating a floating car. This involved creating a complex Actor full of multiple physics components (requiring a deep learn of the Actor Component system and how it handled physics objects), multiple iterations of physics code and adjustments for the car hovering, and then attention to detail with the level design to create race tracks that didn't throw the car around.</p>
                <p>The upside of this is that I learnt my way around a lot of Unreal systems within a fairly short amount of time. During this time I learnt about: The Actor/Component system; C++ coding in the engine; PlayerControllers; Blueprints; The physics engine; Level creation and object placement; Sound components; Level sculpting tools; Unreal's lighting system; Textures, materials, and Unreal's blueprint shader language.</p>
                <p>The parts of the game that I am most proud of are the checkpoints and dynamic audio. The checkpoint code ended up being surprisingly clear and simple. It's very easy to understand what a checkpoint does just by looking at the code. The dynamic audio adds a lot of atmosphere to the game and with surprisingly little code needed for it. It just fades in audio loops that are all running simultaneously, and the Unreal engine does a good job of keeping the loops in sync on it's own.</p>
                <p>In terms of general game creation lessons I took from making this game, I intend to focus on specific systems in the future, rather than attempting to learn everything at once. I will also be more wary of 'simple' physics mechanics. Anything that is more complicated than moving a single physics mesh should be considered complex and I should be aware of the extra work that can come from this. Additionally, 3d levels are a large undertaking for any game and that should be considered when deciding on what type of game to create.</p>
                <p>Reception of the game has been mixed but positive. People especially enjoy the dynamic game audio.</p>
